LPG GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION SYSTEM WITHAUTO CUT-OFF  REGULATOR 

LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) is a widely used fuel in heating appliances, but its leakage poses 
significant risks, including fire hazards, suffocation, and explosions. To address these dangers, we 
propose a reliable gas leakage detection system leveraging an MQ2 gas sensor and an Arduino-micro 
controller. This system not only detects the presence of LPG but also enhances safety by triggering an 
automatic cutoff of the gas supply through a regulator. Additionally, it alerts occupants to the leakage 
via a buzzer alarm. The integration of these components ensures timely detection and response, 
significantly reducing the risks associated with gas leaks. The mentioned problem can be solved with 
the development of reliable techniques to detect gas leakage. We proposed a system to detect gas 
leakage automatically with the help of gas sensor and Arduino microcontroller and alerts the person if 
there is gas leakage by buzzer alarm and auto cutoff regulator.
